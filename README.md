# React useEffect Cleanup Function Inconsistency

This repository demonstrates a common issue with the cleanup function in React's `useEffect` hook.  The cleanup function, intended to run before a component unmounts, sometimes doesn't execute as expected, leading to potential memory leaks or other unexpected behavior.

The `bug.js` file contains the problematic code. The `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version.

## Problem
The `useEffect` hook's cleanup function should run before the component is unmounted. However, in certain scenarios, it might not fire reliably, leading to inconsistencies in the application's behavior. This is particularly evident when rapidly mounting and unmounting the component. 

## Solution
The solution in `bugSolution.js` focuses on ensuring that the cleanup function always has a chance to run properly, even in cases where the component unmounts before the `useEffect`'s cleanup function is called.  Often, this involves thorough testing of unmount cases and making sure there aren't any race conditions interfering with the cleanup process.
